1. We specify it by giving the socket the type of socket.SOCK_STREAM.
2. The server in Python must perform the sequence socket(), bind(), listen(), and accept() whereas the client only needs socket() and connect().
Overall, the client sends/request connections to the server whereas the server waits for requests to send connections. 
3. We use socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1) to control the socket's behavior and 
4. We get port number, host id and client id.
5. An empty byte string is sent to indicate that all the HTTP request was sent.
